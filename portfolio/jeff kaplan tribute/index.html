        <img src="http://bit.ly/jeffWriter" alt="writer" target="_blank" class="img-responsive" id="img1">
        <p class="main-text text-center">Since highschool, Jeff has been a gamer. In college however, he pursued writing rather than a
          career in the video gaming industry, due to a lack of programming skills required for such an occupation.
          According to <a href="http://bit.ly/jeffRS" target="_blank" title="9 Things You Didn't Know About Blizzard's Jeff Kaplan">
          Rolling Stone</a>, he worked for Universal Pictures as a writing intern, but "it didn't meet his romantic expectations about
          how writing for the movies should be". Following the failure of two novels, Jeff decided to give up writing . . . 
          a momentous step that would eventually lead him to his future boss at his dream job.</p>

        <img src="http://bit.ly/jeffKeverQuest" alt="eq" target="_blank" class="img-responsive" id="img2">
        <p class="main-text text-center">During his "playing & working" days, Jeff enjoyed the MMO <span style="font-style:italic">
          EverQuest</span>. Known as "Tigole", Jeff was recognized for his accomplishments & commentary on the
          <a href="http://bit.ly/jeffLoSteel" target="_blank" title="Legacy of Steel Website">"Legacy of Steel" guild website</a>.
          He quickly caught the attention of guild members who happened to work at
          <a href="http://bit.ly/jeffBlizzard" target="_blank" title="Blizzard Website">Blizzard</a>. As time went on, the lead designer of
          <span style="font-style:italic">Warcraft: III</span> asked him to lunch. Jeff nearly declined, but ultimately accepted the
          invitation. That meal would go on to change his whole life.</p>

        <p class="main-text text-center">Jeff began his job on the Blizzard team in 2002 and remains there to this day.
          In regards to his personal life, he ended up meeting & marrying a guildmate from his <span style="font-style:italic">
          EverQuest</span> days. Today, not only is he known for his place on the team of the massively-successful shooter,
          <span style="font-style:italic">Overwatch</span>, but his Developer Update soundbites used in
          <a href="http://bit.ly/dinoflask" target="_blank" title="dinoflask on YouTube">videos</a> by popular Youtuber "dinoflask"
